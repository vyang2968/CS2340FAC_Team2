                <p>
                    The architecture we were tasked to use throughout the semester for this project was MVVM.
                     As you can see below, we had our Model, View, and ViewModel folders set up in Android Studio.

            <h2>Singleton Usage</h2>
                <p>
                    The AuthService class is designed using the singleton pattern to handle user creation and login.
                    Since authentication (login/registration) occurs only once at the start of the application
                    and does not involve concurrent requests, only a single instance is needed. Additionally,
                    the singleton pattern is a good fit because AuthService does not maintain
                    state, ensuring efficient and consistent authentication throughout the app.

            <h2>SOLID Principles</h2>
                <p>
                    In the NavBarScreen class and its subclasses, we implement both the Open-Closed Principle and the Dependency Inversion Principle. 
                    The NavBarScreen class, which extends AppCompatActivity, contains a single method for binding navigation bar buttons in the 
                    activity to their corresponding activities. Any screen designed to include the main navigation bar can inherit from this class, 
                    allowing for easy setup without any need to alter the NavBarScreen class itself. This design makes it open for extension while 
                    remaining closed to modification. Moreover, the NavBarScreen class does not depend on the specific implementations of the classes 
                    that derive from it; those subclasses only need to know that the NavBarScreen handles navigation setup. This approach aligns with 
                    the Dependency Inversion Principle.

                    Furthermore, the DestinationRepositoryImpl class adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. It is solely tasked with handling 
                    CRUD operations for the destinations database. Every method within this class is dedicated exclusively to creating, reading, 
                    updating, or deleting destination records, with no other responsibilities in play.

            <h2>GRASP Principles</h2>
                <p>
                    We adhered to the Creator principle when determining how to instantiate Accommodation objects. Our decision was to have 
                    the AccommodationViewModel take on this role, as it consolidates these objects effectively. The AccommodationViewModel 
                    achieves this through the addAccommodation method, which accepts the necessary parameters to create an Accommodation. It constructs 
                    the object, adds it to the AccommodationViewModel's list, and also updates the accommodation database. Following the Creator 
                    principle, we placed the construction of Accommodation objects in the context where they are utilized most: within the 
                    AccommodationViewModel.

                    Also, the RegisterViewModel aligns with the Information Expert principle, which advocates for tasks to be managed 
                    by the entities that possess the requisite information. The RegisterViewModel holds the user's email and password, thus 
                    it is responsible for validating these credentials and using them to register an account in the database, creating a User 
                    object in the process. It would be counterproductive to delegate these tasks to other components since the RegisterViewModel 
                    already contains the necessary data.

                    We also focused on maintaining Low Coupling in our screen classes. Specifically, we ensured that the AccommodationScreen 
                    class remains unlinked from the Accommodation class. This was accomplished by designing the addAccommodation method in 
                    AccommodationViewModel to accept parameters needed to create an Accommodation object, rather than passing an Accommodation 
                    object directly. This approach results in minimal data coupling, avoiding the more problematic stamp coupling scenario.

            <h2>Strategy Pattern</h2>
                <p>
                    We applied the Strategy pattern by designing a SortMethod interface to sort lists through the compare method from Comparable.
                     We then developed specific implementations of SortMethod to provide alternative sorting behaviors. Classes that require 
                     sorting can select from these implementations to modify how the list is organized. SortMethod serves as the strategy 
                     interface, while implementations like PlannableSortMethod act as concrete strategies. Meanwhile, view models such as 
                     AccommodationsViewModel represent the concrete elements in this context.
